# PRODIGY_DS_03- Building a Decision tree Classifier
 # Problem Statement:
     Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a client subscribed a term deposit or not based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
# Objective:
   To predict whether a client subscribed a term deposit-"yes" or "no"
  # Libraries used:
    > Pandas(data manipulation)
    > ScikitLearn(sklearn)(machine learning models)
  # Steps involved:
          1. import Libraries
          2. import dataset
          3. Exploring data
          4. Checking missing values
          5. Predicting whether a client subscribed a term deposit or not
                        > Encoding categorical variables 
                        > Spliting dataset into Train and Test
                        > Getting accurary and classification_report of target variable
